# Algodal™ Code Style

This is the Algodal™ Code Style (also known as Coding Convention or Coding Guidelines) 
used for all Algodal™ Projects.

## What is Source ?

The source is the content that is required to create the product from the project.  For a software project,
this is the source files.  Within, these source files are variables, types, functions, etc.  The rule for these
are described in detail below.  Non-Source content has rule as well and are described under _Project_.

## Names

Everything has name: project, functions, types and variables.  Naming convention may differ for each thing.
If names contain numbers, the number doesn't affect the naming convention as if the number wasn't there.

## Variables

Variables are written in lower snake-case.  
The subject *(as in, the subject of a sentence)* noun is always the first name followed by 
other nouns, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.  
The *most subject* name is always leftmost.

```
char *president;
char *president_chile;
char *president_chile_football;
int power_windturbines;
int ball_green; //ball is the subject
int green_ball; //green is the subject
```

Some words that go well together can be joined as one word instead of being separated with underscores.
It is up to the programmer's preference.  However, it is recommended, that this is used in few cases so that
the naming of variables remain consistent throughout the code.

```
int bigfoot; # foot_big
```


## Defines and Enum Values

Defines and Enum Values are always written as upper snake-case.

```
LEN
TEXT_LEN
VALUE_A
C
```

## Type

Types are written as Pascal cases.  They are nouns, adjectives or adverbs but never verbs.  
They can be typedef or not.

```
struct Car;
enum Purple;
typedef struct Runnable Runnable;
```

## Functions

Functions are written as Pascal cases.  They are Verbs.  
The verb may be followed by a predicate.  A function may have multiple verbs and predicates.  
In such cases, conjunctions are used to join them.  Predicates may contain conjunctions and prepositions as well.  
The order of the verbs describes the order in which the function executes its internal process.

```
int Get();
int GetSome();
int GetSomeByChoice(int);
int Try();
int TryAndCatch();
int TryOrCatch();
int CatchAndTry(); //different order
```

`Callback` is a special *verb* used for writting callback functions.  Other special words can be used
as *verbs* as well it they are well known in program-jargon.

If any part of the name is an abbreviation that is normally written as all caps, it is converted to
Pascal case.  Dashes or Underscores are collapsed.

```
int GetCmdline(); //CMD Line
int GetUat(); //UAT
int GetUtf8();// UTF-8
int GetAvg(); // AVG
```

## Scope

Scope is written as an uppercase noun followed by a single underscore.  
There can be multiple nouns, and in such cases, Pascal Case is used.  Multiple scopes are concatenated.

```
Project_
CarProject_
CarProject_EngineModule_
```

If the item of the scope is a Define or Enum Value, then the scope is written as all caps.

```
PROJECT_MAX
CARPROJECT_SIZE
CARPROJECT_ENGINEMODULE_LENGTH
```

## File

Files are written in lower snake-case or lower kebab-case or a combination.
Their names descriptive of the features they implement.  
Each file must implement no more than one feature.  That means our code will be grouped according to features.
Also, a feature can be from very specific to very general, so the amount of files needed is user defined.
Lower

```
engine.c
clock.c
new_web_connect.c
hungry_parse.c
ecs.c
screen.c
```

## Folder

Folders can be written as Pascal kebab-case, Pascal snake-case, lower kebab-case or lower snake_case or 
a combination. Try to be consistent across your project in the exact case type use.  Mix may be necessary
due to case of folders generated by tools. There names are 
descriptive of systems **(groups of features)** they contain or implement or the type of data they contain
and can be from specific to general. 

```
visual
sound
controls
server-interface
core-framework
```

## Project

The project name can be anything from some unique name created or a descriptive name.  
A project must solve no more than one purpose.  
If your project goal requires code that solves another purpose, 
don’t include this code as a part of your project but instead create another project for that code base.  
Then you can refer to that project for that code base.

Each project must have its own code, tests, demos, code base, referrals to third-party/other projects code 
and its own scripts.

A project must be a root folder that contains everything it needs, including git, build and resources.  
Referrals can be used for items other than code where plausible.

The root folder of project is written as Pascal kebab-case such as `My-Awesome-Project` or just simply `Project`.

Files in project are designated at certain, places (as seen below) but in some cases that is not ideal.
For example, some of your scripts may need (or you may want) to be in the root directory.  In such cases, you
are allowed to put your files where you need them or want them.  The below is not necessarily a requirement
but a guideline.  Your goal, however, is to keep the overall project consistent and organized.

Special folder names are described below.
It is not required to create all or any of the special folders.  Not all projects will need all of them.
Also, as stated above, it is not a requirement to put certain fails in the below exact folders.  You can put
you files wherever you need or want them.

### Source

`Source` folder is where the source files and source folders go.  It is the root folder of the project's source.

### Other-Source

`Other-Source` this is where you may put source files that are a part of the project but are not necessary for its
functions.  Examples include tests and demo sources.

### Scripts

`Scripts` folder is where all the scripts go.

### Build

`Build` folder is where all the build files go.  It is usually added to .gitignore.

### Data

`Data` folder is where all additional resources needed by the project or product go.  Such as, 
images, sounds, data-files (like json, xml, etc), Licenses for the product, and so on.

### Document

`Document` folder is where all the document generation files go.  Such as,
doxygen and sphinx.

### Design

`Design` folder is where all the design, ideas and planning files for the project go.
